# Welcome to SecurityLab home page

Welcome to B. AIT SALEM Home Page. You can find my courses here.

During my university and industry career, I have developed a solid scientific experience in computer security and embedded systems. I have also developed a rich teaching experience around operating system, network and application security.

These skills are accompanied by a sense of meaning for the human being, with more than 12 years of experience in teaching at universities and engineering schools.

I am able to deliver complex concepts and popularize them for different audiences, with an interest in the reality on the ground and change management (especially with the ever shorter technological cycles that students encounter)
